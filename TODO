-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.3

	paranoia
	 * string freeze

	libotp
	 * keyfile entropy really checked for patterns

	otp
	 * commandline program that can use libotp for general usage

Version 0.4
============
 	paranoia
	 * send entropy warnings (delayed with a timer)
 	 * gettext support (translations)
 	 
Version 0.5
============
 	paranoia
 	 * No pop-up at the beginning of a conversation
 	 	maybe through invisible conversations, needs changes in libpurple
	 * optimize key list (hashtables)

Version 1.0
============
 	paranoia
 	 * no conversation windows that pop-up independently
	 * all pidgin protocols are tested and work
	 * all major languages are available

Misc
 * Test all the less common protocols (Gadu-Gadu, QQ, SIMPLE...)
 * ensure that the protocol is stable

Ideas
 * Entropy pool file
 * Encrypted file transfer
 * Pass controle messages over invisible conversations. Needs changes in purple.

Known bugs
 * there are some anomalies if both set /otp off and one user tries to reenable
 * Sometimes the first "Encryption enabled." message gets lost due to timing problems
 * Finch eats our <otp> markers.
