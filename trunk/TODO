-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.2
============
 	libotp.c
	 * keyfile entropy really checked for patterns 
	 * checking for \0\0\0 on decrypt to check if the message is valid 
		(maybe version 0.3)

 	paranoia.c
	 * add generated key to keylist
 	 * use "buddy-signed-off" signal to reset a session
	 * optimize key list (sort it intelligent)
	 * send entropy warnings (inside messages)
	 * /otp scan, to read in new keys
	 * /otp keys, to list all keys

	other
	 * commandline program that can use libotp for general usage
		(possibly version 0.3)

Version 0.3
============
	paranoia.c
	 * string freeze
	 * add a message queue thread
	 * enhanced session management (auto ack)

Version 1.0
============
 	paranoia.c
 	 * gettext support (translations)
 	 * no conversation windows that pop-up independently
	 * all pidgin protocols are tested and work

Misc
 * Debian/Ubuntu package
 * Test all the less common protocols (Gadu-Gadu, QQ, SIMPLE...)
 * ensure that the protocol is stable

Ideas
 * Entropy pool file
 * Encrypted file transfer
