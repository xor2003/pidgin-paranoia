                     Installation (on Debian/Ubuntu) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file explains how to install pidgin-paranoia.

This procedure was tested on Debian Lenny (amd64/i386) and Ubuntu 8.04 (i386).

If you use Debian or a Debian derivate like Ubuntu, you can use the debian packages.
If you want, you can build the package using the debian/ directory in SVN (see HACKING).

Comments:

 * Commands beginning with '#' are meant to be executed as root whereas commands 
   beginning with '$' are meant to be executed as user.

 * '1:' and '2:' means that you have to do step 1 and step 2, but 'a:' and 'b:'
   means that you can decide between variant a and b.

 * To save time it is recommended to read the whole text first and to install 
   everything at once.

 * The plugin requires libpurple >= 2.2.0 and libglib >= 2.14.

 * The installation should work with other distributions (and maybe even on other OS)
   You just need to find out the names of the required tools and you need to
   make sure that they are new enough. If it does not work please tell us.
