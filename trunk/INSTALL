                     Installation (on Debian/Ubuntu) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file explains how to install pidgin-paranoia in Debian testing.

This procedure was tested on amd64 at the 26.12.2007

Comments:

* Commands beginning with '#' are meant to be executed as root whereas commands 
  beginning with '$' are meant to be executed as user.

* '1:' and '2:' means that you have to do step 1 and step 2, but 'a:' and 'b:'
  means that you can decide between variant a and b.

* To save time it is recommended to read the whole text first and to install 
  everything at once.

* The plugin requires libpurple >= 2.2.0 and libglib >= 2.12.

* The installation should work with other distributions (and maybe even on other OS)
  You just need to find out the names of the required tools and you need to
  make sure that they are new enough. If it does not work please tell us.
