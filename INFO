                     Informations how the plugin works 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0. Abstract:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The plug-in allows to use one-time-pads 
(see: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-Time-Pad) to encrypt conversations in 
the IM-client Pidgin.
A key file with random content is created by Alice. Alice also creates the byte 
wise reverse version of its key file and sends it to Bob. 
Alice and Bob both use the first half of their key file to encrypt and use the 
second part of their key file to decrypt. The message is encrypted and decrypted
 by XOR-ing it with the random bytes taken from the key file. The encrypted 
message is encoded in Base64 and transmitted together with the starting point 
of the bytes used in the key file. 
The plug-in is written in C and released under the GPL (version 3).
The plug-in aims to give 'perfect' security with a encryption system that is a 
simple as possible and easy to understand.

1. Description of the encryption/decryption protocol implemented in libotp:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section describes libotp and is independent of the application libotp is 
used in.

1.1 The key files:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice creates a file consisting of perfectly random numbers (very hard to 
implement, (-;) of a size of i.e 1MB. Alice generates a random 8 characters
 long hexadecimal number (the ID), i.e: "34EF4588". This number must not be 
derived from the key file, because this would weaken the cryptosystem (at 
least in theory)! Alice calls her file 
"alice@jabber.org bob@jabber.org 34EF4588.pad". 
Alice creates the byte wise reverse version of its key file and calls it 
"bob@jabber.org alice@jabber.org 34EF4588.pad".

Alice calls its own key file "alice@jabber.org bob@jabber.org 34EF4588.pad" 
because this key file will be used by her to communicate with Bob.

Alice transfers Bob's key file "bob@jabber.org alice@jabber.org 34EF4588.pad" 
to Bob over a secure channel, i.e on CD. Alice does not need Bob's key file 
anymore and can delete it.

Both Alice and Bob can use the first half of their key file for encryption. 
The second part of the key file is used to decrypt the message.

1.2 Encryption:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice finds the first byte in her key file that is not \0. Alice takes one byte 
from the key file for every byte of her message and creates her encrypted 
message using byte wise XOR. Alice writes \0 into the key file at the position 
were the pad was used to encrypt the message. This ensures that every part of 
the pad is only used once and the encryption is therefore secure! The encrypted 
message is converted into Base64 (i.e. "M+Rla2w=") to ensure compatibility with 
different transport layers.

A string formed like "3EF9|34EF4588|M+Rla2w=" is transmitted.
 * "3EF9" is the position (as a hexadecimal number) where Alice started reading 
   in her key file.
 * "34EF4588" is the ID used to check if both have compatible key files.
 * "M+Rla2w=" is the Base64 encoded encrypted message.

1.3 Decryption:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob decodes the Base64 encoded message and decrypts it with that bytes read 
from the key file in reverse order at the position (counting from the end of 
the key file) described in the transmitted string.

1.4 Key and session management:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the plugin start a key list gets initialized depeding on the available key 
files. The data is stord in a linked list containing an otp (libotp.h) and an 
options (paranoia.c) struct. Every time the user wants to send a message or 
receives a message the plugin searches for a matching key in the key list.

2. Description of the Pidgin one-time-pad plugin
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This section describes the Pidgin plugin that uses libotp.

2.1 Initialisation:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When a conversation starts and a matching key is available, the plugin sends a 
special request message: "*** Request for conversation with the Pidgin-Paranoia 
plugin ($ID): I'm paranoid, please download the One-Time Pag plugin (link) to 
communicate encrypted." or similar. If the receiving user has the plugin and 
a matching key this message won't be displayed. Instead the plugin 
automatically sends the message "*** Encrypted with the Pidgin-Paranoia plugin: 
" + "paranoia" (encrypted).
If the plugin is able to decrypt that message, it activates the encryption for 
this key id. All following messages are automatically encrypted and have the 
following structure: "*** Encrypted with the Pidgin-Paranoia plugin: " + the 
encrypted message.

Every time a conversation gets closed (or updated) all option are reset to 
default and a new initialisation is needed. If the opposite client sends an 
unencypted message, our plugin stops sending encrypted messages too.
