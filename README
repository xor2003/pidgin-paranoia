To build the keygen file use: ./build.sh

At the moment the entropie is collected by the devices /dev/audio and /dev/random and furthermore from thread timing. Planned are also to collect entropie from mouse and keyboard events and eventually from system state.

Eventhough I try the best, I as author don't guarantee that the collected entropie is good enough to outstand any attacks against information encrypted with this key.

If you have any wishes or critics feel free to send me an e-mail to: psachs@student.ethz.ch
