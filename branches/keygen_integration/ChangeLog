Christan WÃ¤ckerlin:
 * One-time pad documentation
 * Libotp: xor function
 * Libotp: base64 encode and decode using gnomelib
 * Libotp: encrypt and decrypt
 * Libotp: struct *mypad is generated from keyfile
 * Libotp: Keyfile templates added
 * Libotp: Full keyfile support
 * Added support for the ./configure --disable-otp swich that disables libotp
   support for development.
 * Added support for protected entropy signaling (i.e. no entropy  signal)
 * Added support for keyfile creation
 * Added support for the destruction of keyfiles (using up all entropy)
 * Added support for key check using repeatprobability.
 * Added support for addition of a random tail onto the encrypted message 
   to prevent 'eve' from knowing the exact length of the message


Known bugs:
 * there are some anomalies if both set /otp off and one user tries to reenable
 * Keyfile creation function is not threaded and therfore locks pidgin
 * More then one key per conversation is not supported yet
 * Sometimes the first "Encryption enabled." message gets lost due to timing problems
