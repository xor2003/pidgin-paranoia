Version 0.3
============
	paranoia
	 * /otp scan, to read in new keys
	 * add a message queue thread
	 	* enhanced session management (auto ack)
	 	* send entropy warnings
	 * modular key management (par_key_list.h)
	 * string freeze

	libotp
	 * checking for \0\0\0 on decrypt to check if the message is valid 
	 * keyfile entropy really checked for patterns

	otp
	 * commandline program that can use libotp for general usage

Version 0.4
============
 	paranoia
 	 * gettext support (translations)
	 * optimize key list (hashtable or tree)

Version 1.0
============
 	paranoia
 	 * no conversation windows that pop-up independently
	 * all pidgin protocols are tested and work
	 * all major languages are available

Misc
 * Test all the less common protocols (Gadu-Gadu, QQ, SIMPLE...)
 * ensure that the protocol is stable

Ideas
 * Entropy pool file
 * Encrypted file transfer

Known bugs
 * there are some anomalies if both set /otp off and one user tries to reenable
 * Sometimes the first "Encryption enabled." message gets lost due to timing problems
 * Finch eats our <otp> markers.
