Pidgin-Paranoia - The one-time pad plugin for people who really care about privacy

0.3.0 (04-10-2008):
	Our third release focuses on stability and usability improvements.
	Session handshake can be expected to work _all_ the time, the user
	gets live feedback about the current state during key generation and the 
	consistency of received messages is checked. 
	In addition, 0.3 provides performance improvements that allow the 
	software to scale better then ever with the increasing number of paranoid 
	people in your contact who all have an increasing number of concurrent 
	keys. The performance of the key generator has also been greatly improved.

	We consider the software to be in beta stage and suitable for everyday use.
	
	For your convenience Debian/Ubuntu packages are supplied for i386 and amd64.

0.2.0 (26-03-2008):
	Our second release brings many new features like support for multiple keys 
	per buddy, a new threaded keygen and better handling of the keyfiles.
	We think it is pretty stable and consider it in late alpha stage since
	it is not 100% feature complete. We consider it suitable for everyday use.
	
	For your convenience Debian/Ubuntu packages are supplied for i386/amd64.

0.1.0 (30-12-2007):
	Enjoy our first release! Basic functionality of information-theoretically 
	secure encrypted instant messaging and key generation is provided. We 
	consider it alpha quality, but it should not SIGSEGV :-)
