Pidgin-Paranoia - The one-time pad plugin for people who really care about privacy

0.1.0 (30-12-2007):
	Enjoy our first release! Basic functionality of information-theoretically 
	secure encrypted instant messaging and key generation is provided. We 
	consider it alpha quality, but it should not SIGSEGV :-)
