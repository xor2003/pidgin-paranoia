Pidgin-Paranoia - The one-time pad plugin for people who really care about privacy

0.1.0 (30-12-2007):
	Enjoy our first release! Basic functionality of information-theoretically 
	secure encrypted instant messaging and key generation is provided. We 
	consider it alpha quality, but it should not SIGSEGV :-)

0.2.0 (26-03-2008):
	Our second release brings many new features like support for multiple keys 
	per buddy, a new threaded keygen and better handling of the keyfiles.
	We think it is pretty stable and consider it in late alpha stage since
	it is not 100% feature complete. We consider it suitable for everyday use.
	
	For your convenience Debian/Ubuntu packages are supplied for i386/amd64.
